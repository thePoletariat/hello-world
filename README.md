# hello-world
GitHub Demo Repository

Hey everybody,

This is a snapshot of me learning code, dev, engineering, programming...whatever you call it. I don't even know myself. 
I'm doing this because I have been advised that reading documentation is KEY in coding world. So here I am, following along with GitHubs very own documentation :)

HALP!
